# Description
In this notebook, we will be investigating the sales and ratings of video games from 2000 to 2016. 
The CRISP-DM (Cross-industry standard process for data mining) process will be followed during this notebook.
After analyzing data, we will try to also predict some made up new games with a self-created machine learning model.

# Motivation
As a passionate gamer I stumbled across a video game dataset including metacritic ratings. 
Having it downloaded, a few questions shot into mind.
* What data can we analyze from a video game dataset found "in the wild" in the first place? 
* How are certain publishers doing?
* Can we predict ratings of new games?
* Which platform receives the highest ratings?
* How did sales change through the years?

#Results
* What data can we analyze from a video game dataset found "in the wild" in the first place? 
  * Ratings
    * Critic ratings went down
    * User ratings went up
    * Cutover in 2011
* How are certain publishers doing?
  * Nintendo delivers high quality ratings constantly
  * Konami get's better and better
* Can we predict ratings of new games?
  * With the small dataset we have, no, not really
* Which platform receives the highest ratings?
  * The PC unmatchingly received the highest critic ratings
* How did sales change through the years?
  * The sales peaked in 2008 and went down constantly from that on
 
Please look at the notebook for more insights.
