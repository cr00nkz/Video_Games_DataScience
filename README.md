# Motivation

In this notebook, we will be investigating the sales and ratings of video games from 2000 to 2016. For this the dataset Video_Games_Sales_as_at_22_Dec_2016.csv prepared by Rush Kirubi was downloaded from kaggle.com (https://www.kaggle.com/rush4ratio/video-game-sales-with-ratings).

The CRISP-DM (Cross-industry standard process for data mining) process will be followed during this notebook.

After analyzing data, we will try to also predict some made up new games with a self-created machine learning model.
